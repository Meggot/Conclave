This was my final year project at university, and is a fully developed conferencing application that allows users to enter chat rooms and chat via text or webcam. Admins can create, close and open rooms, as well as mute, kick, ban users. Conclave is intended to be secure, thus all information is encrypted using AES key pairs generated by the server client, which is then handed to each user in a secure medium to link them uniquly to the server. Usernames are logged against keys and keys can be rendered invalid at anytime in the event of a comprimise. 

Conclave: This is the server application.
ConclaveClient: This is the client application.
ConclaveLoadTester: This application was used to stress test the server against numerous types of requests. To be run on a different computers on the same network. 

The server will initiate a derby database, and runs off port 1099. All code contains tests as this was developed in a TDD environment
